## Improvements based on P3 peer review feedback

- Add to favorites and add to shopping list buttons dont dissapear when clicked, instead they become disabled.
- On the favorites page, clicking on a favorite item brings up the recipe detail page for that recipe.
- On the shopping list page, clicking on an ingredient opens a new browser window redirecting the user to the appropriate ingredient on amazon.com.
